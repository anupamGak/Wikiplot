									<p>An 18-year-old girl named Drew Decker (Carmen Electra) receives a threatening phone call while home alone one night. Drew is chased outside by Ghostface, who wounds her with a stab to the breast that removes her implant. She is hit by a vehicle driven by her father, who was distracted by oral sex from his wife, and is then killed by Ghostface.</p>
<p>The next morning, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) meets up with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams) and her friends, Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Greg Phillipe (Lochlyn Munro), and Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth). Various news teams, including hack reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri), converge on the school in the wake of Drew's death. Gail hooks up with Buffy's mentally disabled brother Doofy (Dave Sheridan) hoping to milk the facts out of him.</p>
<p>While Cindy is in class, she receives a note reading: "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST HALLOWEEN!" She then realizes that Drew was murdered exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man during a wild car ride. The next day a series of increasingly bizarre events take place. Various members of the group receive threatening notes from Ghostface and are rapidly dispatched.</p>
<p>Greg is killed by Ghostface in plain view during Buffy's beauty pageant, with the audience mistaking Buffy's screams as being part of her act. Buffy, high on the success brought along by her win, ignores Cindy's warnings about the killer and does not realize she is being killed as it happens, even after she is decapitated (and the killer tosses her head in a Lost and Found bin, though her head keeps talking). Ray and Brenda go to a showing of <i>Shakespeare In Love</i>, where Ray is stabbed in the ear through a bathroom stall. Ghostface then goes after Brenda. Unfortunately, angry movie patrons, fed up with Brenda's rude behavior during the movie, kill her before Ghostface can.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cindy throws a house party, hoping for safety in numbers. During the party, Bobby and Cindy go upstairs and they have sex, no longer making Cindy a virgin (though Bobby ejaculates waterfall proportions of semen inside of Cindy, that blast her up and sticks her to the ceiling). Ghostface unexpectedly appears and stabs Bobby, before disappearing quickly. Cindy gets a gun from a drawer near the entrance, Bobby follows and she tends to his wounds. Brenda's stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) comes up from the basement and informs them that the killer has murdered everybody in the house.</p>
<p>Bobby takes the gun and shoots Shorty, revealing that his wound was an elaborate ruse. Ray arrives on the scene, alive; he and Bobby announce their plan to Cindy to kill her and her father (despite the fact that they are not actually the killers). Ray and Bobby also plan to make themselves look like heroes by giving each other stab wounds to indicate they fought back, but the plan backfires when Ray stabs Bobby repeatedly and nearly kills him, furious because his favorite show, <i>The Wayans Bros.</i>, has been cancelled. Ghostface abruptly arrives and attacks Cindy during a fight of karate after stabbing Ray, but she successfully subdues him by employing moves copied from <i>The Matrix</i> (and by doing a brief Irish jig while levitating) and kicks him through a window. Nonetheless, Ghostface vanishes before the police arrive.</p>
<p>At the police station, Cindy and the local sheriff (Kurt Fuller) realize that Doofy, the only one who knew about the car accident, was actually faking his disability and is the true killer. Unfortunately, Doofy has already escaped with Gail Hailstorm. Upon finding his discarded disguise in the street, Cindy begins screaming, causing her to be get hit by a car.</p>
<p>In a post credit scene, Shorty appears and breaks the fourth wall by giving tips on how to survive a horror movie. The ways tips he gives is you got to be quick, don't fall down and the most important one is to never look back. After that he yells "Snatch and run ya'll!" then him and his friends turn out to be at a gas station store and steal the food and drinks from the gas station as the man at the cash register yells after them to stop.</p>
